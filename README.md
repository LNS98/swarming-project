This is the starting information for the Warwick Third Year Physics Project by Yoanna Peneva and Lorenzo Niccolini. 
The purpose of this code is to simulate collective motion of self-propelled particles. The different files are structured according to progress made weekly. 

Week 1-5
a)	Program with several functions producing random motion of a single particle and a particle in a straight line.
b)	Program that inserts lots of particles in box
c)	Get lots of particles on the thing and make them align. However, code is buggy and the particles produces random walks so the alignment function needs to be altered.
d)	Correct Vicsek model with a printed starting alignment and end alignment for the agents.
e)	Vicsek Model with alignment graph with respect to time step printed.
f)	Vicsek Model with alignment vs noise graph produced - highlighting the phase transition between the two states. 

Week 6
a)	Vicsek Model with alignment graph with respect to time step printed.
b)	Vicsek Model with alignment vs noise graph produced - highlighting the phase transition between the two states
c)	This program calculates the averages of alignment for each noise value.
d)	This program calculates the averages (including the previously calculated) of alignment for each noise value producing a more accurate phase transition value. 
e)	Plots all averages for the alignment of each system. 

Week 8
a)	Vicsek Model with alignment vs noise graph produced - highlighting the phase transition between the two states
b)	This file contains a program which will update velocity according to neighboursâ€™ forces. Noise is still angular only. 
c)	Combined repulsive and alignment into a nearly finished program.
